## What is a compiler?

It is used to translate human readable code into binary code (zeroes and ones) that microchips, cpus, and other hardware can understand.

High Level Programming - The programming language is more human friendly.  It has a lot more "real world" analogies. You focus on writing instructions humans can understand, and let the compiler figure out how to manage the resources of your computer (eg. automatic garbage collector for memory).

Low Level Programming - the programming language doesn't have as many features, and you might working more closely with the hardware.  FOr example, you might need to state specifically which blocks of memory in your memory chip to use, or you might interact more closely with the CPU clocks.

## How to start coding

1. Download a compiler
2. Write some code
3. Use the compiler or run the code

Compiled code
- Java 
- C++
- C
- go
- C#

Runtime

## Popular Shell Commands for *nix

Synonyms - Terminal, command line, shell, bash, powershell

```
ls # list files and directories
ls -alh # list files and directories including hidden directories in a list format and make numbers human readable
pwd # present working directory
cd <directory name> # change directory
cp <source file name> <target file name> # copy file
rm <file name>  # remove file
mv <source file name> <target file name> # move file
rmdir <directory name> # remove directory
rm -rf <file name> # recursively force remove file and directories
clear # clears the screen

```
