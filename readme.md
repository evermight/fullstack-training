# ABOUT THE GROUP
Hey Everyone! 

Our WhatsApp Group is here incase you need to ask any questions: https://chat.whatsapp.com/Gxhx8bRkxWZJ56cjOCTlp2

My goal is to train people with *zero* knowledge of computer programming to be abel to build their own web apps for fun/prototyping.  Then we will delve deeper into more advance programming topics necessary to be employed as a full stack developer. Over the next few weeks, we'll cover these topics:

- backend coding (JavaScript/nodejs)
- database development (MySQL or mongo)
- frontend coding (html css)
- server/system maintenance
- GitHub
- CI/CD
- automated testing - unit test, integration test, bdd test, end-to-end test
- WordPress development - since it's so popular, everyone should have basic coding knowledge of it
- Web development framework (express, meteor, or something similar)

I will record our lectures and post on YouTube so you can all reference it afterwards and to also help others in the public space.  I will try to avoid showing the pictures of people in the video to make things more private:

If you have issues with the recordings being posted, then you can always just watch the lectures afterwards then post your questions to our WhatsApp Group.

To participate, all you need is a computer.   We will install tools to help you code!
