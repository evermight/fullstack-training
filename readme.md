# ABOUT THE GROUP
Hey Everyone! 

My goal is to give my nephew Anthony enough skills to actually work in industry as a junior full stack developer.  And you are all welcome to participate.  People learn faster as a team!  Over the next few weeks, we'll cover these topics:

- backend coding (JavaScript/nodejs)
- database development (MySQL or mongo)
- frontend coding (html css)
- server/system maintenance
- GitHub
- CI/CD
- automated testing - unit test, integration test, bdd test, end-to-end test
- WordPress development - since it's so popular, everyone should have basic coding knowledge of it
- Web development framework (express, meteor, or something similar)

In terms of the actual schedule, we'll just go based on how quickly Anthony and a few others move along.    I will give some practice exercises that are optional for people to do.  With so many people, I can't grade the assignments.  But what I'll do is try to answer people's questions on here.  And would be good if everyone helped each other out if they knew the answer to anyone else's programming questions and bugs.

I will record our lectures and post on YouTube as UNLISTED so you can all reference it afterwards.  I'll try to avoid showing the pictures of people in the video to make things more private.   Also, I will likely edit these videos and then post it as a public video on one of my YouTube channels to help everyone else in the programming community:

If you have issues with the recordings being posted, then you can always just watch the lectures afterwards then post your questions here.

To participate, all you need is a computer.   We will install tools to help you code!
