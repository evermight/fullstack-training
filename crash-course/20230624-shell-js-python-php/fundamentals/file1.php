We will print some strings. These strings can be rendered in several possible displays:

1) Print directly to the screen by running the command line
  php file1.php

2) Save the output to a file by using this command line
  php file1.php > somefilename

The word somefilename can be replaced with any filename.

3) If a webserver like Apache is installed to work with php, simply going to this script from a web browser will let you see the output
